## Starting with Spectra
```{r starting with spectra}
# first part of MS data
spd <- DataFrame(msLevel = c(1L, 2L),
          rtime = c(10.1, 24))
spd

#still requires raw data to be more like MS data. Use list

spd$mz <- list(c(100, 103.2, 104.3, 106.5),
     c(45.6, 120.4, 190.2))

spd$intensity <- list(c(200, 400, 34.2, 17),
     c(12.3, 15.2, 6.8))

spd

#simple dataframe set up, nothing specific to MS yet. Now we can use the `Spectra` package to convert generic dataframe to object specific to MS

sp <- Spectra(spd)

#sp is an object of class "Spectra" which is specific to MS datasets
sp

#As can be seen, most of the variables are not populated
spectraVariables(sp)

#The values of these variables can be accessed
spectraData(sp)

# as well as individual spectra
peaksData(sp)

peaksData(sp)[[1]]

## Getting raw MS data from a public repository
